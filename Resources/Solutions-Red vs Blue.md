# Red vs. Blue Team Project 

Red Team vs. Blue Team scenario,
as the Red Team, we will attack a vulnerable VM within your environment, ultimately gaining root access to the machine. 
As Blue Team, we will use Kibana to review logs taken during their Day 1 engagement. We'll use the logs to extract hard data and visualizations for report.


### Lab Environment

The Hyper-V Manager to access the nested machines:

- **ELK machine credentials:** The same ELK setup that we created in Project [ELK-Stack-Project](https://github.com/Diablo5G/ELK-Stack-Project).
    - Username: `vagrant`
    - Password: `vagrant`
    - IP Address: `192.168.1.100`

- **Kali:** A standard Kali Linux machine
    - Username: `root`
    - Password: `toor`
    - IP Address: `192.168.1.90`

- **Capstone:** Filebeat and Metricbeat are installed and will forward logs to the ELK machine. 
   - IP Address: `192.168.1.105`
